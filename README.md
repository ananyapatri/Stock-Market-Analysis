## Installing Dependencies

There are 3 important files. All of the files utilize the same dependencies which reside in environment.txt. First create a virtual environment using python3. In your terminal, create a folder, download all of this code in it, and enter this code:(make sure you are in the folder when you create the environment)

```
python3 -m venv senv
```

This creates a virtual environment with the name senv. To activate it, enter this code

```
source senv/bin/activate
```

now you are in the virtual environment. Next, enter this code to download the dependencies from requirments.txt

```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
